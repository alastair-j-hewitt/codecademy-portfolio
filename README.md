# README

On a proceeding application which I am working on locally, the line:  <%= javascript_include_tag 'application', 'data-turbolinks-track' => true %> , breaks the application for whatever reason.  This could be behind why this portfolio app failed to deploy to Heroku as I believe it is also in an application.html.erb file here.  Leaving this as a note to check for later in case I want to come back to it


This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...
